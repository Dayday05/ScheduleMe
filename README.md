## **ScheduleMe ?**

App for creating articles and organize friday's afternoon with various topics from team members.

**Why ?**

The idea from ScheduleMe was born after a meeting about why we stopped our friday's afternoon workshop and how can we restart the initiative of scheduling afternoon's meetings with team members.

**What can I do with this App ?**

With ScheduleMe, you can create various articles ( news about the latests update release of programming libraries/framework, events etc...) and organize different workshops with team members to share knowledge, practice some programming skills etc.
