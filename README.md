# **ScheduleMe**

**How ?**

The idea from ScheduleMe was born after a meeting about why we stopped our friday's afternoon workshop and how can we restart the initiative of scheduling afternoon's meetings with team members.

**What can I do with this ?**

ScheduleMe is "plug & play" app, you log in with your favorite social network and then you have access to various content published by your team members or other collaborators.
But the heart of this application is about scheduling and with all the various tools this app have to offer, you and your team never miss an event/workshop/meeting ever again !
